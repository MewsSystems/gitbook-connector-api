# Guidelines

This part describes guidelines for general usage of the Connector API.

## Requests

The API accepts only `HTTP POST` requests with `Content-Type` set to `application/json` and JSON content depending on the operation to be performed. All operations follow this address pattern:

```text
[PlatformAddress]/api/connector/v1/[Resource]/[Operation]
```

* **PlatformAddress** - Base address of the MEWS platform, depends on environment \(testing, staging, production\).
* **Resource** - Logical group of operations, in most cases identifies target of the operations.
* **Operation** - Name of the operation to be performed.

### Body

```javascript
{
    "ClientToken": "E0D439EE522F44368DC78E1BFB03710C-D24FB11DBE31D4621C4817E028D9E1D",
    "AccessToken": "C66EF7B239D24632943D115EDE9CB810-EA00F8FD8294692C940F6B5A8F9453D",
    "Client": "Sample Client 1.0.0",
    "LanguageCode": null,
    "CultureCode": null 
}
```

| Property | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ClientToken` | string | required | Token identifying the client application. |
| `AccessToken` | string | required | Access token of the client application. |
| `Client` | string | required | Name and version of the client application. |
| `LanguageCode` | string | optional | Code of the [language](operations/configuration.md#language). |
| `CultureCode` | string | optional | Code of the culture. |

All operations of the API require `ClientToken` and `AccessToken` to be present in the request. The `ClientToken` serves as an identificator of the client using the API. The `AccessToken` grants the client access to data of an enterprise in the system. For development purposes, use the demo environment. For production usage, the `ClientToken` will be provided to you by our integration team and `AccessToken` by admin of the enterprise. See [Authentication](guidelines.md#authentication) for further details.

All operations of the API optionally accept `LanguageCode` and `CultureCode`. These can be used to enforce language and culture of the operation which affects e.g. names of entities, descriptions or error messages. Both of these values must be defined together otherwise default values of the [Enterprise](operations/configuration.md#enterprise) are used.

## Responses

The API responds with `Content-Type` set to `application/json` and JSON content. In case of success, the HTTP status code is 200 and the content contains result according to the call. In case of error, there are multiple HTTP status codes for different types of errors:

* `400 Bad Request` - Error caused by the client app, e.g. in case of malformed request or invalid identifier of a resource. In most cases, such an error signifies a bug in the client app \(consumer of the API\).
* `401 Unauthorized` - Error caused by usage of invalid access token.
* `403 Forbidden` - Server error that should be reported to the end user of the client app. Happens for example when the server-side validation fails or when a business-logic check is violated.
* `500 Internal Server Error` - Unexpected error of the server. In most cases, such an error signifies a bug on our side. We are logging it and immediately notified when such error happens. If anything like this happens, feel free to directly contact us or raise an issue here on Github.

In case of any error, the returned JSON object describes the error and has the following properties:

| Property | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Message` | string | required | Description of the error. |
| `Details` | string | optional | Additional details about the error \(request, headers, server stack trace, inner exceptions etc.\). Only available on development environment. |

Some errors may also contain additional information relevant to the error on top of this two properties. But that depends on the operation and is specifically described in the operation documentation.

## Authentication

Authentication and tokens that have to be used depending on environment.

### Demo environment

This environment is meant to be used during implementation of the client applications.

* **PlatformAddress** - `https://demo.mews.li`
* **ClientToken** - `E0D439EE522F44368DC78E1BFB03710C-D24FB11DBE31D4621C4817E028D9E1D`
* **AccessToken** - `C66EF7B239D24632943D115EDE9CB810-EA00F8FD8294692C940F6B5A8F9453D`

The enterprise is based in UK, it accepts `GBP`, `EUR` and `USD` currencies \(any of them may be used\), as a tax rate, either `0.0`, `0.05` or `0.20` can be used. The predefined accounting categories have codes: `FOOD`, `BVG` and `ABVG`. To sign into the system, use the following credentials:

* **URL** - `https://demo.mews.li`
* **Email** - `connector-api@mews.li`
* **Password** - `connector-api`

### Production environment

* **PlatformAddress** - `https://www.mews.li`
* **ClientToken** - Will be provided to you by our integration team. For further information, please contact [integrations@mewssystems.com](mailto://integrations@mewssystems.com).
* **AccessToken** - Depends on the enterprise, should be provided to you by the enterprise admin.

## Datetimes

Some operations of the API accept datetimes in their parameters or return them in their results. The datetimes are represented as `string`s following the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations) formatting rules. Moreover they should always be in [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#UTC) so that it is clear which instant they represent and there is no room for confusion. Putting this all together means that the expected format of datetimes is `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ`. This format is also used in return values.

As an example, consider an operation that takes datetime interval in its parameters. And let's say we want to fully cover 1st and 2nd of January 2017 in an enterprise that is located in timezone UTC+2. Then the interval in the local time is:

* Start `2017-01-01T00:00:00+02:00`
* End `2017-01-03T00:00:00+02:00`

In order to pass this interval to the API, it has to be converted to UTC:

* StartUtc `2016-12-31T22:00:00Z`
* EndUtc `2017-01-02T22:00:00Z`

## Durations

Some operations of the API accept durations in their parameters or return them in their results. The durations are represented as `string`s following the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) formatting rules.

As an example, consider minimum and maximum length of the reservation:

* MinLength `P0Y0M1DT0H0M0S`
* MaxLength `P0Y0M3DT0H0M0S`
