# Customer loyalty

Loyalty scheme providers can use the **Mews Connector API** to synchronize their loyalty programs with **Mews Operations**.
Hotel staff can then easily access a guest's membership status, including loyalty tier such as "Gold member", through the guest profile within the Mews system.

> ### Loyalty data model
>
> The data model for Loyalty consists of three main entities:
> * **Loyalty Program**<br>This is the main loyalty scheme or program. A guest can be a member of multiple programs.
> * **Loyalty Tier**<br>You can optionally define tiers or levels of membership for your program.
> * **Loyalty Membership**<br>A Loyalty Membership describes the relationship between a customer or guest and a loyalty program. This includes reward points, loyalty tier and membership expiration date.

## Chains

Loyalty programs are set up in Mews at the above-property chain level. However, this does not prevent individual properties (called _Enterprises_ in Mews) from having loyalty programs, because a property by default is in a chain of one.

> ### Where can I obtain the Chain identifier?
>
> You can obtain the Chain identifier for an enterprise or property using [Get configuration](../operations/configuration.md#get-configuration).

## Set up loyalty programs

Use [Add loyalty programs](../operations/loyaltyprograms.md#add-loyalty-programs) to create your loyalty programs in Mews. If using a normal, single enterprise Access Token, the programs will be created for the chain corresponding to the enterprise within scope of the Access Token. If using a multi-property [Portfolio Access Token](../guidelines/multi-property.md), you must specify the `ChainId`. The programs will then be created for the specified chain.

To create a program, you must specify a program name, program code (used to match the loyalty on bookings such as those coming in to Mews from the [Mews Channel Manager API](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/channel-manager-api)), type of program, and subscription model (`Free` or `Paid`). To see what loyalty programs are already set up, use [Get all loyalty programs](../operations/loyaltyprograms.md#get-all-loyalty-programs), which can be called with various filter parameters, depending on your requirements.

> ### How can I validate the Loyalty Programs setup?
>
> With access to **Mews Operations**, you can go to the Loyalty section of the Customer Profile and manually add a customer to a program. The available programs should reflect what you have configured through the API.

## Set up loyalty tiers

If any of the loyalty programs use tiers, set up those tiers and link them to the programs, using [Add loyalty tiers](../operations/loyaltytiers.md#add-loyalty-tiers). To see what loyalty tiers are already set up, use [Get all loyalty tiers](../operations/loyaltytiers.md#get-all-loyalty-tiers), which can be called with various filter parameters, depending on your requirements. To make changes to existing loyalty tiers, use [Update loyalty tiers](../operations/loyaltytiers.md#update-loyalty-tiers). To delete unwanted loyalty tiers, use [Delete loyalty tiers](../operations/loyaltytiers.md#delete-loyalty-tiers).

## Add guests to loyalty programs

Loyalty Memberships are used to connect guests (called _Customers_ in Mews) with loyalty programs. To connect a guest or customer to a loyalty program, use [Add loyalty memberships](../operations/loyaltymemberships.md#add-loyalty-memberships). Specify the identifier of the loyalty program, the identifier of the customer account, and optionally you can specify their reward points, a membership expiration date, a URL to an entry in your loyalty system, a loyalty tier that the customer belongs to, and/or the state of their membership, e.g. `Pending`. If the customer is a member of more than one loyalty program within scope of the chain, specify which one is the primary program against which points should be allocated, using the `isPrimary` JSON property.
To fetch a list of guest memberships, use [Get all loyalty memberships](../operations/loyaltymemberships.md#get-all-loyalty-memberships), which can be called with various filter parameters.

## Maintain your guest memberships

To make changes to guest loyalty memberships, use [Update loyalty memberships](../operations/loyaltymemberships.md#update-loyalty-memberships). To remove guest loyalty memberships, use [Delete loyalty memberships](../operations/loyaltymemberships.md#delete-loyalty-memberships).
