# Guidelines

This section provides important guidelines on how to use the __Mews Connector API__. For information about individual endpoints or operations, see [API Operations](../operations/README.md).

> ### Terminology
> Some of the terms used in the API, such as *enterprise*, *customer* or *resource* may not be familiar.
> For example, we use *resource* to describe guest rooms and other types of bookable space.
> For a full description of all the terms used, see the [Mews Glossary for Open API users](https://help.mews.com/s/article/Mews-Glossary-for-Open-API-users?language=en_US).
