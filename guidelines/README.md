# Usage guidelines

This section provides important guidelines on how to use the __Mews Connector API__. For a deeper understanding of Mews concepts, see [Concepts](../concepts/README.md). For information about individual endpoints or operations, see [API Operations](../operations/README.md).

> ### Terminology
