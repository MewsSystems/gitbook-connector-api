# Environments

There are two pricing environments in which enterprises can operate - Gross or Net.
* Gross Pricing Environments are environments in which taxes are *included* in the pricing that is offered to a customer, such as Germany, UK, Australia.
* Net Pricing Environments are environments in which taxes are *excluded* in the pricing that is offered to a customer, such as in the US.

## Taxations

Each enterprise is located in a specific [Tax environment](../operations/taxenvironments.md#tax-environment) that offers a list of applicable [Taxations](../operations/taxations.md#taxation). The numeric value of the taxations are represented by [Tax rate codes](../operations/taxations.md#tax-rate) that are accepted within the tax environment. 

Instead of numeric tax rates such as `0.1`, use [Tax rate codes](../operations/taxations.md#tax-rate) such as `AT-S` in order to represent and calculate the correct taxation for each accounting item in Mews. To obtain the applicable codes, first download the enterprise information with [Get configuration](../operations/configuration.md#get-configuration) to identify the Tax Environment, then filter for the applicable [Tax rate codes](../operations/taxations.md#tax-rate) from all tax environment information retrieved via [Get all tax environments](../operations/taxenvironments.md#get-all-tax-environments). 

Make sure to note the validity intervals as well as any government announcements to anticipate changes to tax rates. Should any changes occur, re-retrieve enterprise and tax environment information to identify the new tax rate codes.
