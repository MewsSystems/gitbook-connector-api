| Property | Type | Contract | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `StartOffset` | string | required | Offset from the start of the [time unit](#time-unit) which defines the default start of the service; expressed in ISO 8601 duration format. |
| `EndOffset` | string | required | Offset from the end of the [time unit](#time-unit) which defines the default end of the service; expressed in ISO 8601 duration format. |
| `OccupancyStartOffset` | string | required | Offset from the start of the [time unit](#time-unit) which defines the occupancy start of the service; expressed in ISO 8601 duration format. 'Occupancy start' is used for availability and reporting purposes, it implies the time at which the booked resource is considered occupied. |
| `OccupancyEndOffset` | string | required | Offset from the end of the [time unit](#time-unit) which defines the occupancy end of the service; expressed in ISO 8601 duration format. 'Occupancy end' is used for availability and reporting purposes, it implies the time at which the booked resource is no longer considered occupied. |
| `TimeUnitPeriod` | [Time unit period](#time-unit-period) | required | The length of time or period represented by a [time unit](#time-unit), for which the service can be booked. |

#### Time unit

Bookable Services are booked in terms of integer multiples of standard `time units`. The length of a time unit depends on the particular service and is given by `time unit period`, which can be obtained through [Get all services](#get-all-services). For example, a service with a time unit period of "Day" can be booked in multiples of days. This is equivalent to booking a hotel room stay for a specified number of days or a specified number of nights.

A monthly time unit, i.e. a time unit with time unit period of "Month", starts at midnight on the first day of the month and ends at midnight on the first day of the following month.

The service is not assumed to start at the beginning of a time unit, e.g. 00:00 midnight for a "Day", nor end at the end of a time unit, e.g. the following midnight. Instead we define `StartOffset` as the offset from the beginning of the time unit at which the service starts, and `EndOffset` as the offset from the end of the time unit at which the service actually ends - see the illustrations below. Similarly, `OccupancyStartOffset` and `OccupancyEndOffset` define the offsets for which the service is considered occupied.

A positive value for `EndOffset` is normal for a nightly stay and implies that the service ends on the following morning. A negative value for `EndOffset` can be used to specify a daytime service that ends before the end of the day.

## Get service availability

Returns availability of a bookable service for a specified time interval including applied availability adjustments. Availability will be returned for all service [time units](services.md#time-unit) that the specified time interval intersects. So, for example, an interval `1st Jan 23:00 UTC - 1st Jan 23:00 UTC` will result in one price for `2nd Jan`, while Interval `1st Jan 23:00 UTC - 2nd Jan 23:00 UTC` will result in two prices for `2nd Jan` and `3rd Jan` (assuming a time unit period of "Day"). UTC timestamps must correspond to the start boundary of a [time unit](services.md#time-unit), e.g. 00:00 converted to UTC for a time unit of "Day". Other timestamps are not permitted. The __maximum size of time interval__ is 100 time units or 2 years, whichever is the shorter amount of time.

## Update service availability

Updates the number of available resources in [Resource category](resources.md#resource-category) by a certain amount (relative adjustment). Note that availabilities are defined per time unit, so when the server receives the UTC interval, it first converts it to enterprise timezone and updates the availability on all time units that the interval intersects. It's not allowed to update past availabilities outside of `EditableHistoryInterval`, future updates are allowed for up to 5 years.
